# 🚀 Welcome to 2brackets

2brackets is a home for innovative and secure open-source projects — starting with [VaultNest](https://github.com/2brackets/vaultnest.clients), a self-hosted digital vault for passwords, secrets, and documents.

🌱 We're growing an ecosystem of tools designed for transparency, control, and community.
